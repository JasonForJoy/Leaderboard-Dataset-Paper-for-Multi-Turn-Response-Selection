# Multi-Turn Response Selection in Retrieval-Based Chatbots

Multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots is a task which aims to select the best-matched response from a set of candidates, given the context of a conversation. This task is attracting more and more attention in academia and industry. However, no one has maintained a leaderboard and a collection of popular papers and datasets yet. The main objective of this repository is to provide the reader with a quick overview of benchmark datasets and the state-of-the-art studies on this task, which serves as a stepping stone for further research.
